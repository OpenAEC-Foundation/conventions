## Shared issue assignment

Repositories can call `.github/workflows/auto-assign-issues.yml` to assign newly
opened issues to their product owners:

```yaml
name: Auto-assign issues to product owner

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions:
  issues: write

jobs:
  assign:
    uses: OpenAEC-Foundation/conventions/.github/workflows/auto-assign-issues.yml@main
    with:
      assignees: '["JohnHeikens"]'
```

The required `assignees` input is a JSON array of GitHub usernames and supports
multiple owners. The workflow uses the calling repository's token and issue
number. Callers must grant `issues: write`; reusable workflows cannot increase
their callers' permissions. No additional token or secret is required.

To assign an existing issue manually, add this trigger to the caller:

```yaml
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      issue_number:
        description: Existing issue number to assign
        required: true
        type: number
```

Pass `issue_number: ${{ inputs.issue_number || github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number }}`
alongside `assignees` in the calling job's `with` block. The optional
`issue_number` input otherwise defaults to the triggering issue or pull request.
Manual runs require write access to the calling repository.

Callers that also assign pull requests can retain their `pull_request: opened`
trigger and grant `pull-requests: write` alongside `issues: write`. Assignment
errors fail the workflow so they remain visible. Calls reference `@main` so
changes to the shared implementation apply to all callers.
